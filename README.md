# Python Programming Laboratory (21CSL46)



The Python Programming Laboratory course (21CSL46) introduces students to Python fundamentals, data types, flow control, functions, and object-oriented programming. It covers regular expressions, file handling, and working with Excel, PDF, Word, and JSON files. CIE and SEE assessments ensure comprehensive learning and practical application.

## Course Overview

1. **Python Fundamentals and Flow Control:**
   - Write Python programs to find the best of two test average marks and check for palindromes:
   - 1. Introduce the Python fundamentals, data types, operators, flow control and exception handling in Python
(a) Write a python program to find the best of two test average marks out of three testâ€™s marks accepted from the user.
(b) Develop a Python program to check whether a given number is palindrome or not and also count the number of occurrences of each digit in the input number.


2. **Functions and Parameters:**
   - Implement functions to calculate Fibonacci numbers and convert between number systems:
   - 2. Demonstrating creation of functions, passing parameters and return values
(a) Defined as a function F as Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. Write a Python program which accepts a value for N (where N > 0) as input and pass this value to the function. Display suitable error message if the condition for input value is not followed.
(b) Develop a python program to convert binary to decimal, octal to hexadecimal using functions.

3. **String Manipulation:**
   - Develop programs to analyze sentences and compare string similarity:
   - 3. Demonstration of manipulation of strings using string methods
(a) Write a Python program that accepts a sentence and find the number of words, digits, uppercase letters and lowercase letters.
(b) Write a Python program to find the string similarity between two given strings
Sample Output: Sample Output:
Original string: Original string:
Python Exercises Python Exercises
Python Exercises Python Exercise
Similarity between two said strings: Similarity between two said strings:
1.0 0.967741935483871

4. **Collections:**
   - Explore lists, tuples, and dictionaries to implement sorting algorithms and convert Roman numerals:
   - 4. Discuss different collections like list, tuple and dictionary
(a) Write a python program to implement insertion sort and merge sort using lists
(b) Write a program to convert roman numbers in to integer values using dictionaries.


5. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Create functions to recognize patterns and search for phone numbers and email addresses:
   - 5. Demonstration of pattern recognition with and without using regular expressions
(a) Write a function called isphonenumber () to recognize a pattern 415-555-4242 without using regular expression and also write the code to recognize the same pattern
(b) Develop a python program that could search the text in a file for phone numbers (+919900889977) and email addresses (sample@gmail.com)

6. **File Operations:**
   - Perform operations on files, including reading, writing, and organizing data. Create ZIP files:
   - 6. Demonstration of reading, writing and organizing files.
(a) Write a python program to accept a file name from the user and perform the following operations
1. Display the first N line of the file
2. Find the frequency of occurrence of the word accepted from the user in the file
(b) Write a python program to create a ZIP file of a particular folder which contains several files inside it.

7. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Utilize inheritance to find areas of geometric shapes and manage employee details:
   - 7. Demonstration of the concepts of classes, methods, objects and inheritance
(a) By using the concept of inheritance write a python program to find the area of triangle, circle and rectangle.
(b) Write a python program by creating a class called Employee to store the details of Name, Employee_ID, Department and Salary, and implement a method to update salary of employees belonging to a given department.

8. **Polymorphism and Overriding:**
   - Implement polymorphic functions to check palindromes:
   - 8. Demonstration of classes and methods with polymorphism and overriding
(a) Write a python program to find the whether the given input is palindrome or not (for both string and integer) using the concept of polymorphism and inheritance.

9. **Data Handling:**
   - Download XKCD comics and manipulate spreadsheet data:
   - 9. Demonstration of working with excel spreadsheets and web scraping
(a) Write a python program to download the all XKCD comics
(b) Demonstrate python program to read the data from the spreadsheet and write the data in to the spreadsheet

10. **File Formats:**
    - Combine PDF pages and fetch weather data from JSON files:
    - 10. Demonstration of working with PDF, word and JSON files
(a) Write a python program to combine select pages from many PDFs
(b) Write a python program to fetch current weather data from the JSON file

## Assessment
This course includes continuous internal evaluation (CIE) and semester-end examination (SEE) to ensure comprehensive learning and practical application.
