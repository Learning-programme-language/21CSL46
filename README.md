# Python Programming Laboratory (21CSL46)



The Python Programming Laboratory course (21CSL46) introduces students to Python fundamentals, data types, flow control, functions, and object-oriented programming. It covers regular expressions, file handling, and working with Excel, PDF, Word, and JSON files. CIE and SEE assessments ensure comprehensive learning and practical application.

## Course Overview

1. **Python Fundamentals and Flow Control:**
   - Write Python programs to find the best of two test average marks and check for palindromes.

2. **Functions and Parameters:**
   - Implement functions to calculate Fibonacci numbers and convert between number systems.

3. **String Manipulation:**
   - Develop programs to analyze sentences and compare string similarity.

4. **Collections:**
   - Explore lists, tuples, and dictionaries to implement sorting algorithms and convert Roman numerals.

5. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Create functions to recognize patterns and search for phone numbers and email addresses.

6. **File Operations:**
   - Perform operations on files, including reading, writing, and organizing data. Create ZIP files.

7. **Object-Oriented Programming:**
   - Utilize inheritance to find areas of geometric shapes and manage employee details.

8. **Polymorphism and Overriding:**
   - Implement polymorphic functions to check palindromes.

9. **Data Handling:**
   - Download XKCD comics and manipulate spreadsheet data.

10. **File Formats:**
    - Combine PDF pages and fetch weather data from JSON files.

## Assessment
This course includes continuous internal evaluation (CIE) and semester-end examination (SEE) to ensure comprehensive learning and practical application.
